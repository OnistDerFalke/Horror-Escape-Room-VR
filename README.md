### Find the light
Darkness is your second name? No? You’d better find something to help you navigate this eerie void. An unsettling stillness envelops you, and the shadows seem to pulse with menace. Who knows what danger lurks in the darkness? Perhaps it’s the beast that prowls nearby, its eyes glinting like polished daggers, waiting for the moment to strike. As the air grows heavy with tension, remember: in this realm, the monster isn’t just a figment of your imagination—it's hungry, and it knows you’re here.

### Solve puzzles and escape
There are three puzzles ahead. You need to pass them all if you don't want to be eaten by monster. Can you pass the game in 30 mins?

### (Don't) panic.
You are not alone in this eerie darkness, but that knowledge offers little comfort. Stay calm and focused if you want to survive, for panic can lead to reckless decisions that may cost you everything. Every sound in the shadows could signal danger, so trust your instincts and prepare for whatever lurks just out of sight.
