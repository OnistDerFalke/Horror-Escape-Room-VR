# Movement

According to buttons defined on site ![](https://help.inspiritvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/15488182886804-Meta-Quest-2-Touch-Controllers), in this project we used on oculus:
* Thumbstick left - to walk by player
* Grip right - picking up objects
* Grip left - putting things away
* Trigger button left - putting the torch away
* Trigger button right - interacting with interface

### Find the light!
Scary lighting system and post processes, better use torch or die alone in the darkness. Monster is nearby!
